Inspired by the Correlation Guessing Game, this notebook processes a black and white image of data points on a graph, then identifies the slope of the graph.

As part of the process, the notebobok automatically identifies X, Y coordinates for data points, which makes it a handy backup for anyone who loses access to original data or is trying to validate results.
