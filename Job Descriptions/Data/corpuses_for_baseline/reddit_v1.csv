nfl,Freeman: A few facts on Mack from league sources: 1. Gruden barely spoke to Mack and Mack felt disrespected from the start. 2. Raiders players are in a sense of shock right now. Mack is highly respected in that locker room. 3. Gruden has pondered trading Mack since taking the job.
nfl,"[Jahns] Khalil Mack is joining a #Bears defense that returns players with starting experience at all positions and finished 2017 as 10th in total defense, 9th in scoring, 8th in passing defense and t-7th in sacks. And it's still run by Vic Fangio, who stayed on despite coaching change."
nfl,"Hawkins: In the words of Jeff Garcia, ""Jon Gruden likes to date players, not marry them"" Never commits to big talent (esp QBs) because big contracts are admitting they are good. An admittance that they are good means he forfeits the ""we need the right guy"" excuse when team starts losing"
nfl,"[Yates]The Raiders traded a third round pick (79th overall) for a player entering the final year of his deal, only to (likely) cut him before he ever plays a snap for them."
